GOAL: To come up with a trading strategy using the relationship between FX rates and global stock index prices.

Worked on model and realized that Matlab is terrible with multiple regression. It has no diagnostic tools especially for multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity. 

*I checked visually for normality, serial correlation and heteroscedasticity and could not see anything.* [fairly confident about this but never know for sure...]

To test of multicollinearity, you can look at the correlation matrix which tells you something, but not everything. Variance inflation factors (VIFs) are more accurate supposedly, and you can use the correlation matrix to calculate VIFs: inv(correlation matrix^Transpose) [I believe] gives you the VIFS for each indep var. A value around 10 or more indicates multicollinearity. All my indep vars results in values that were in their 20s!! So need to confirm this.

To do that I need the matrix of indep vars used in the stepwise reg. How do I create a matrix of said variables? Matlab does not allow you to do that in one step!!

Possible solutions:
(1) Create a database from the equities data
(2) Create individual series of each equity so I can add/drop and create interaction terms if necessary -- this might be more effective, but a lot more work.
(3) ...?

Starting to split up the data extraction and download files with the regression analysis so I can run repeated regressions without having to keep downloading the data. Need to finish this tomorrow.

Also plan to create an individual series of equity index data so that I can play around with it more. Will do this tomorrow.

Split up the data extraction and analysis.

Also figured out a way to extract the series of predictors from the entire series of equities. 

Still have to figure out a way to get the interaction variables.

Today, I looked at the summary stats over the last 5-6 years (2007-13). I looked at:
(1) each individual years as well as
(2A) averages across all the years as well as 
(2B) a subset of the years.

Looking at the data one can see a few things very clearly:

(1) There are clear patterns in the data through the day.
(2) Trades cluster around the hour.
	2A. For years before the crisis (basically 2007) and for years well after the crisis (2012/13), there are patterns within the hour, i.e., the prices start low and increase over the hour.
	2B. For the crisis years, these patterns seem to be there, but not as distinct.
(3) No real consistent patterns across the years in skewness, kurtosis or standard deviation.

IMPORTANT: Based off of DeRosa's "4-pip" rule, there seems to be a basic strategy of buying in the morning and selling in the afternoon that *could* potentially lead to a gain of four pips...
